\chapter{Problem 1}

First we need to define parameters for the problem. Let us assume that days of a week starting from Monday are numerated as $i = 1,2,...,5$ respectively.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item $b_i$ = Buying price defined for the $i$th day.
	\item $s_i$ = Selling price defined for the $i$th day.
	\item $m_i$ = Number of shares bought on $i$th day.
	\item $n_i$ = Number of shares sold on $i$th day.
	\item $x_i$ = Number of shares owned at the end of $i$th day.
	\item $y_i$ = Amount of money owned at the end of $i$th day. 
\end{itemize}

The objective is,
\begin{equation}
	max \{y_5\}
\end{equation}

such that,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
y_0 &= 100 \\
x_0 &= 0 \\
y_i &= y_{i-1} + s_i*n_i - b_i*m_i \\
x_i &= x_{i-1} + m_i - n_i \\
n_i & \leq x_{i-1} \\
b_i*m_i &\leq y_{i-1} \\
m_i, n_i, x_i, y_i &\geq 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}
